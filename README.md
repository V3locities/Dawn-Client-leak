# Dawn-Client-leak

This client is mashup type shit not even 1 percent of the code is not skidded
It was on intent.store for like couple of minutes but got removed after Nefarious (Intent Owner)
realized that it was skidded and is nowhere near the requirements of intent,
The client can also be deobfuscated in 10m but i was too lazy and even if i had the motiviation
i still have no pc..
